\title{Convert Ensembl transcript IDs to gene names
Useful when processing existing data that didn't come in through prep_expression_matrix.R
If multiple transcripts map to the same gene, their expression values are summed (as in tximport's summarize-to-gene behavior)}
\usage{
map_gene_names(df, ensembl_host = "ensembl.org")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{(tbl_df) SxG df where sampleinfo is stored in sampleinfo attr}

\item{ensembl_host}{ensembl biomart host URL}
}
\value{
SxG df with expression data and _GENE column edited
}
