#' Description from the author:
#' Tumor associated macrophages and T cells were characterized in a cohort of 73
#' ccRCC and 5 healthy donors using mass cytometry. Macrophage and T cell subsets
#' of interest were identified and sorted directly from samples known to contain
#' a high frequency of these subsets. CD8+ PD-1- T cells (n=6), exhausted CD8+
#' PD-1+ T cells (n=6), control macrophages CD14+ HLA-DR+ CD204- CD38- CD206- (n=11)
#' and a population of TAM characterized as CD14+ HLA-DR+ CD204+ CD38+ CD206- (n=6)
#' were isolated using FACS sorting.
